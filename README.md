# **AI Virtual Mouse**

Transform the way you interact with your computer with the **AI Virtual Mouse**! This innovative project replaces traditional mouse hardware by enabling hand-gesture-based control. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like OpenCV and Mediapipe, it delivers a seamless and hands-free user experience for moving the cursor, clicking, and performing other essential mouse actions.

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Captures hand movements and gestures using a webcam.
- **Cursor Control**: Moves the mouse pointer based on your hand's position.
- **One-Touch Clicking**: Click actions are triggered through gestures.
- **Smooth Gesture Recognition**: Gesture detection is fast, responsive, and highly accurate.
- **Lightweight and Accessible**: Works on any device with a camera and Python installed.

## **How It Works**
1. **Hand Detection**: Utilizes Mediapipe's Hand Tracking model to identify 21 hand landmarks.
2. **Gesture Recognition**: Analyzes hand poses (like raised fingers or pinching gestures) to detect user intent.
3. **Action Execution**: Translates gestures into mouse actions like movement, clicks, or scrolling.
4. **Screen Mapping**: Ensures smooth and precise cursor movements by mapping hand positions to the screen's resolution.

## **Key Gestures**
- **Pointer Movement**: Control the cursor by moving your index finger.
- **Single Click**: Bring the index and thumb fingertips together briefly.
- **Drag and Drop**: Pinch and hold your fingers while moving your hand.
- **Scroll Up/Down**: Gesture with your hand vertically.
